If we have a class AngryCat how do we create a new instance of this class?

The AngryCat class might look something like this:

class AngryCat
  def hiss
    puts "Hisssss!!!"
  end
end
=end

# My Answer

# By invoking #new on AngryCat.  
# We can do it on it's own
# AngryCat.new
# Or assign it to a variable
# my_cat = AngryCat.new
