There are a number of variables listed below. What are the different types and how do you know which is which?

excited_dog = "excited dog"
@excited_dog = "excited dog"
@@excited_dog = "excited dog"

=end

# My Answer:

# excited_dog = "excited dog" # => assigns the string 'excited dog' a local variable

# @excited_dog = "excited dog" # => assigns the string 'excited dog' an instance variable

# @@excited_dog = "excited dog" # => assigns the string 'excited dog'  a class variable

# The prefix (or lack thereof) tells us what type of variable the string is assinged.
