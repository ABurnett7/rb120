Using the Card class from the previous exercise, create a Deck class that contains all of the standard 52 playing cards. 

class Card
  include Comparable
  attr_reader :rank, :suit

  VALUES = { 'Jack' => 11, 'Queen' => 12, 'King' => 13, 'Ace' => 14 }

  def initialize(rank, suit)
    @rank = rank
    @suit = suit
  end

  def to_s
    "#{rank} of #{suit}"
  end

  def value
    VALUES.fetch(rank, rank)
  end

  def <=>(other_card)
    value <=> other_card.value
  end
end

Use the following code to start your work:

class Deck
  RANKS = ((2..10).to_a + %w(Jack Queen King Ace)).freeze
  SUITS = %w(Hearts Clubs Diamonds Spades).freeze
end

The Deck class should provide a #draw method to deal one card. The Deck should be shuffled when it is initialized and, if it runs out of cards, it should reset itself by generating a new set of 52 shuffled cards.

Examples:

deck = Deck.new
drawn = []
52.times { drawn << deck.draw }
drawn.count { |card| card.rank == 5 } == 4
drawn.count { |card| card.suit == 'Hearts' } == 13

drawn2 = []

class Card
  include Comparable
  attr_reader :rank, :suit
  
  VALUES = { 'Jack' => 11, 'Queen' => 12, 'King' => 13, 'Ace' => 14 }
  
  def initialize(rank, suit)
    @rank = rank
    @suit = suit
  end
  
  def to_s
    "#{rank} of #{suit}"
  end
  
  def value
    VALUES.fetch(rank, rank)
  end
  
  def <=>(other_card)
    value <=> other_card.value
  end
  end
  
  class Deck
  attr_accessor :deck
  RANKS = ((2..10).to_a + %w(Jack Queen King Ace)).freeze
  SUITS = %w(Hearts Clubs Diamonds Spades).freeze
  
  def initialize
    @deck = []
    new_deck
  end
  
  def draw
    new_deck if deck.empty? 
    @deck.pop
  end

  private
  def new_deck
    RANKS.each do |rank|
      SUITS.each do |suit|
        @deck << Card.new(rank, suit)
      end
    end
    @deck.shuffle!
  end
end
  
deck = Deck.new
drawn = []
52.times { drawn << deck.draw }
p drawn.count { |card| card.rank == 5 } == 4
p drawn.count { |card| card.suit == 'Hearts' } == 13

drawn2 = []
52.times { drawn2 << deck.draw }
p drawn != drawn2 # Almost always.
